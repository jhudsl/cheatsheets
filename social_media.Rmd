# Best Practices:

<input type="checkbox">  Check that you have been transparent 

  - "I'm a scientist @FredHutch. Opinions are my own, reposts aren't endorsements."

<input type="checkbox">  Check that you have cited and/or tagged sources and collaborators

<input type="checkbox">  Check that you are not violating patient or intellectual privacy

<input type="checkbox">  Check if you are using sarcasm or tone that might be lost in translation

<input type="checkbox">  Check that you have added a creative element

  - Use stories, anecdotes, images, videos, art, GIFs, poetry, [cartoons](https://getavataaars.com/), [memes](https://giphy.com/categories/memes)
  - Be cautious about memes - may not target right audience

<input type="checkbox">  If you are unsure, don't post it!
