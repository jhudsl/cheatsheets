Conferences can feel intimidating, especially your first few.

But don't worry, this is a common feeling.
You deserve to be attend and no one knows what all the talks are about.
In fact, conferences are for branching out and learning new things!

# Best Practices:

<input type="checkbox">  Don't try to absorb everything! <img src="https://thenounproject.com/icon/mind-blown-1164518/" width = 8%>

- Focus on your interests, but also check out new topics.

<input type="checkbox">  Take notes <img src="https://www.iconpacks.net/icons/free-icons-6/free-icon-notes-and-pencil-22337.png" width = 8%>

- It can be difficult to retain what you learn, so take notes. Include information about the researchers and relevant papers, so you can reach out or learn more.

<input type="checkbox">  Get ideas <img src="https://www.iconpacks.net/icons/4/free-icon-light-bulb-13629.png" width = 8%>

<input type="checkbox">  Talk to people <img src="https://www.iconpacks.net/icons/4/free-icon-conversation-11886.png" width = 8%>

-  You never know who you might be sitting next to! Find new collaborators, people who know about helpful new methods, opportunities, jobs, etc.
-  Start with small talk, talk about a presentation, or talk about your work
- Transition times, after talks, and during breaks are good opportunities to meet people
- Talk to speakers, ask questions (this can be after a talk or during the talk)
- Email people or connect on LinkedIn
